Cancer is a complex disease and a global burden. EMT is one of the main steps in cancer progression. Logical modelling is a powerful qualitative modelling approach to model large EMT gene regulatory and signalling networks.
EpiLog is a software to do logical modelling in a multicellular environment. It accepts a cellular model in SBML format and apply this model on a grid of cells. So, in each cell there is a Signalling Network (SG). Each SG has inputs which come from The neighbouring cells. This is how cells affect one another. Inputs are defined based on the integration functions. An integration function is a logical function which explain how a cell could receive some inputs in a multicellular environment.
